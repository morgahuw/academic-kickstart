Welcome to Incognito Theatre.  We hope you enjoy finding out about us and our productions.

We have a friendly, lively and active membership of about 130 members and stage 6 productions a year to a consistently high standard.

As a theatre group we started life in 1938 and since 1948 we have been running our own well equipped 64 seat theatre in Friern Barnet, North London.

Much work and modification was needed to turn this ex-lemonade factory into a fully functioning, well-equipped theatre. By 1948 the work was complete and ITG has been putting on plays to consistently high standards ever since.

In the summer of 2007, we embarked on a major project to entirely reconstruct the upstairs dressing rooms and the costume/props storage space. As a result, we now have two very comfortable dressing rooms (one large and one small) and a much more organized and useable storage facility.

Not content with this, in January 2010 we completed the construction of a new foyer, lighting box and scenery store. We also took the opportunity to significantly improve disabled access to the theatre.

The entire project was made possible by a fund-raising programme called IncogACTion 2010 Access for All. We raised a total of Â£150K and this was all down to the hard work and generosity of our members and audience. The highlight of the venture was a Gala dinner attended by over 200 guests and our patron Sir David Jason.

The effect of all these changes has made for a much more enjoyable theatre experience for both performer and audience member alike. We are now regularly sold out for all our plays.

ITG aims to make high quality live theatre accessible to local actors, back-stage crew, technicians, directors, designers, writers and audiences and to enrich their lives and benefit the community generally.

ITG has an Equal Opportunities Policy and a proud history of training young actors, most notably Sir David Jason who started his distinguished career with ITG and is also our patron.

The group participates in the annual Barnet Drama Festival and has won many awards over the years.

As a final note, the building that ITG occupies has a rather interesting history. From about 1901 it used to be a lemonade factory! If you are interested in knowing more, click here to read a full history of the building.
