The theatre is behind 106 - 114 Holly Park Road with access through the former clinic site.

Although we only have limited parking facilities at the theatre (there are nine spaces plus a disabled bay), there is ample parking in the neighbouring streets (Bellvue Road, Glenthorne Road, Carlton Road).  However, it would be appreciated if you could avoid parking in Holly Park Road itself.
