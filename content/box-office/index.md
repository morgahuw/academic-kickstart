Although the phone is not manned 24 hours a day, you can leave a message and the Box Office Manager will return your call as soon as they are able to.
 
We usually sell out for all our performances so it is advisable to book early and not to just turn up on the night - you will probably be disappointed!

Tickets are priced at £11 for non-members, £10 for members and £5 for students.

Sunday performances start at 6pm, Saturday matinée performances start at 3pm and all other performances start at 8pm.  Doors open 30 minutes before the performance starts.

Audience members who have a hearing aid, can switch it to the T-position to take advantage of the auditorium's induction loop.

Latecomers can only be admitted at a suitable break in the performance.
